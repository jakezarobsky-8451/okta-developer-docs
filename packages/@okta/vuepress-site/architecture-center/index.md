      Directory coexistence architectures provide solutions for problems around user, group, and device data migration. Often the issues are around switching to Okta over time, or consolidating multiple disparate identity sources (online and on-premises) into one. Whatever the case here, Okta has you covered. <a class="main-card__link" href="/architecture-center/directory-coexistence/">Learn more</a>

      Managing Multiple Okta Deployments (MMOD) architectures provide solutions for deploying and managing multiple application environments via Terraform. Okta applications typically have separate production, staging, and development environments and commonly support multiple customer domains, all of which need to be quickly and accurately updated and maintained. Whatever your needs, combining Okta's cloud-based deployment solutions with Terraform allows you to efficiently and reliably create, manage, and update your infrastructure resources. <a class="main-card__link" href="/architecture-center/mmod/">Learn more</a>
